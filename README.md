## Problem Statement:
XYZ Distributors is a Marico distributor in Greater Ramgarh town of population 1.25 lakhs This was earlier a stockist town and XYZ Distributors was a Marico stockist for 5 years before being upgraded
to a direct distributor 3 months ago.
The distributor is also a direct distributor for GCPL, Zydus Wellness, Parle and Marico contributes 20% of his total monthly sales.
The Stockist was earlier doing an average monthly sale of Rs 8.5 lakhs and covered a total of 175 outlets with one shared salesperson and operated combined delivery with other companies.
The stockist was earlier covered by PSR Ramesh who used to visit the stockist market 5-6 times a month.

### Key Actions Taken After Upgrade:
1. Geo-tagging of outlets (25% done so far)
2. Beat plans created for 2 DSRs to cover 450 outlets
3. PDA for DSRs implemented
4. TSO joint market work - average 3 days a month
5. Sales call process training for DSRs (done 3 months ago)
6. Distributor trained on CSNG systems for daily billing
7. POSM setup across outlets
8. 50 top outlets contribute 70% of sales

## Issues Identified:
- Low momentum after upgrade despite higher investments
- Failure to meet benchmarks such as LPC and EC
- DSRs achieving only 40% of potential incentive

## Root Cause of Non-Achievement:
The distributor faces increased operational costs without sufficient revenue growth to justify the transition from stockist to direct distributor. Factors include low Effective Coverage (EC) and Lines Per Call (LPC), as well as insufficient engagement from the Territory Sales Officer (TSO).

## Corrective Actions:
1. **Improve DSR Efficiency**: Increase weekly joint market work with DSRs to at least 4 days a month to address coverage issues.
2. **Enhance Geo-Tagging**: Complete geo-tagging of outlets to ensure accurate coverage.
3. **Increase Sales Engagement**: Focus on training DSRs to improve Lines Per Call (LPC) and daily PC/DSR to align with targets.
4. **Incentivization**: Adjust incentive structure to motivate DSRs towards higher performance.
5. **Review Market Credit Terms**: Negotiate to reduce market credit from 20 days to the benchmark of 15 days.
6. **POSM Utilization**: Ensure full and strategic use of POSM to enhance brand visibility.
